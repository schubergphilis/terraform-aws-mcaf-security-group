# terraform-aws-mcaf-security-group

Terraform module to manage an AWS Security Group.

> [!NOTE]  
> This module only supports `name_prefix` as input and not `name`. Changing a security groupâ€™s `name` in Terraform forces its replacement, which can cause deployment failures due to dependencies with other AWS resources. Since AWS does not allow deleting a security group that is still associated with another resource. Using `name_prefix` avoids unnecessary recreation, and `create_before_destroy` ensures smooth updates without disruption.
